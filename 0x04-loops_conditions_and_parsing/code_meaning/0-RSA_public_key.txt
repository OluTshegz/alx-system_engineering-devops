To generate an RSA SSH key pair, you can use the `ssh-keygen` command-line tool. Follow the instructions below to generate the key pair:

1. Open a terminal on your Linux or macOS system.

2. Run the following command to generate the key pair:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ```

   This command specifies the key type (`-t rsa`) as RSA and the key length (`-b 4096`) as 4096 bits. You can adjust the key length according to your requirements.

3. You will be prompted to provide the file name for the key pair. Press Enter to accept the default file location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) or specify a different file name and path if desired.

4. You will then be prompted to enter a passphrase. Adding a passphrase is optional but recommended for increased security. If you choose to use a passphrase, enter it and press Enter. Alternatively, you can press Enter twice to create a key without a passphrase.

5. The key pair will be generated, and you will see output similar to the following:

   ```
   Generating public/private rsa key pair.
   Enter file in which to save the key (/home/olusegun/.ssh/id_rsa):
   /home/olusegun/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
   Overwrite (y/n)? y
   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
   Enter same passphrase again:
   Your identification has been saved in /home/olusegun/.ssh/id_rsa
   Your public key has been saved in /home/olusegun/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   The key fingerprint is:
   SHA256:Z4XL+BsKqu4XMqACCATamqh8KPD1cJ199R++26mXbNs olusegun@OluTshegz
   The key's randomart image is:
   +---[RSA 4096]----+
   |+.               |
   |o.         .     |
   |+ .       . . .  |
   |=o     . = o . . |
   |B.  o . S * .  ..|
   |*.+..+   + .  . o|
   |+o.+ .o   o   ..o|
   |. . .. . . o   ==|
   | o+o.   . .  .+=E|
   +----[SHA256]-----+
   ```

   The `id_rsa` file is the private key, and the `id_rsa.pub` file is the public key.

6. Share your public key, which is stored in the `id_rsa.pub` file, as requested. You can retrieve the contents of the public key by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

   Copy the output and provide it in your answer file as `0-RSA_public_key.pub`.

Remember to keep your private key (`id_rsa`) in a secure location and never share it with others.
