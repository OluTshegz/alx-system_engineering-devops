#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This bash script that listens on port `98` on `localhost`
# The script uses the nc command (netcat) to listen on port 98 on localhost.
# It will wait for incoming connections on port 98 and display any text received on the terminal.
# To test the script, you can open another terminal and use telnet to connect to localhost on port 98.
# Type some text, and you should see the text being displayed in the terminal where the script is running.

nc -l localhost 98
