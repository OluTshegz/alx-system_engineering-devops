# 0x1A. Application server

DevOps, SysAdmin

### Concepts

_For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:_

--   [Web Server](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/17)
# Web Server

**Do not mix up web server and server.**

A web server is a software that delivers web pages. A server is an actual computer.

But you might hear people referring to a  **web server**  using the word  **server**. (Check out the  **server**  concept page to learn more about this.)

As mentioned above, a server is a physical machine, an actual computer, but in the Cloud era that could also be a virtual computer, generally called a VM ([Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine "Virtual Machine")) or  [container](https://www.cio.com/article/247005/what-are-containers-and-why-do-you-need-them.html "container").

--   [Server](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/67)
# Server

Servers are located in datacenters which are buildings that host hundreds, or even thousands of computers (servers). You can think of a server as a computer without a keyboard, mouse, or screen, that is accessible only by a network. A server can be physical or virtual. A server runs an OS (operating system).

# Web stack debugging

# Intro

Debugging usually takes a big chunk of a software engineer’s time. The art of debugging is tough and it takes years, even decades to master, and that is why seasoned software engineers are the best at it… experience. They have seen lots of broken code, buggy systems, weird edge cases and race conditions.

# Non-exhaustive guide to debugging

## School specific

If you are struggling to get something right that is run on the checker, like a Bash script or a piece of code, keep in mind that you can simulate the flow by starting a Docker container with the distribution that is specified in the requirements and by running your code. Check the  **Docker**  concept page for more info.

## Test and verify your assumptions

The idea is to ask a set of questions until you find the issue. For example, if you installed a web server and it isn’t serving a page when browsing the IP, here are some questions you can ask yourself to start debugging:

-   Is the web server started? - You can check using the service manager, also double check by checking process list.
-   On what port should it listen? - Check your web server configuration
-   Is it actually listening on this port? -  `netstat -lpdn`  - run as  `root`  or  `sudo`  so that you can see the process for each listening port
-   It is listening on the correct server IP? -  `netstat`  is also your friend here
-   Is there a firewall enabled?
-   Have you looked at logs? - usually in  `/var/log`  and  `tail -f`  is your friend
-   Can I connect to the HTTP port from the location I am browsing from? -  `curl`  is your friend

There is a good chance that at this point you will already have found part of the issue.

## Get a quick overview of the machine state

[Youtube video First 5 Commands When I Connect on a Linux Server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_gqlbADaAw&feature=youtu.be "Youtube video First 5 Commands When I Connect on a Linux Server")

When you connect to a server/machine/computer/container you want to understand what’s happened recently and what’s happening now, and you can do this with  [5 commands](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/first-5-commands-when-i-connect-linux-server/ "5 commands")  in a minute or less:

### `w`

-   shows server  [uptime](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/uptime-and-downtime "uptime")  which is the time during which the server has been continuously running
-   shows which users are connected to the server
-   load average will give you a good sense of the server health - (read more about load  [here](https://scoutapm.com/blog/understanding-load-averages "here")  and  [here](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-08-08/linux-load-averages.html "here"))

### `history`

-   shows which commands were previously run by the user you are currently connected to
-   you can learn a lot about what type of work was previously performed on the machine, and what could have gone wrong with it
-   where you might want to start your debugging work

### `top`

-   shows what is currently running on this server
-   order results by CPU, memory utilization and catch the ones that are resource intensive

### `df`

-   shows disk utilization

### `netstat`

-   what port and IP your server is listening on
-   what processes are using sockets
-   try  `netstat -lpn`  on a Ubuntu machine

## Machine

Debugging is pretty much about verifying assumptions, in a perfect world the software or system we are working on would be working perfectly, the server is in perfect shape and everybody is happy. But actually, it NEVER goes this way, things ALWAYS fail (it’s tremendous!).

For the machine level, you want to ask yourself these questions:

-   Does the server have free disk space? -  `df`
-   Is the server able to keep up with CPU load? -  `w`,  `top`,  `ps`
-   Does the server have available memory?  `free`
-   Are the server disk(s) able to keep up with read/write IO? -  `htop`

If the answer is  **no**  for any of these questions, then that might be the reason why things are not going as expected. There are often 3 ways of solving the issue:

-   free up resources (stop process(es) or reduce their resource consumption)
-   increase the machine resources (adding memory, CPU, disk space…)
-   distributing the resource usage to other machines

## Network issue

For the machine level, you want to ask yourself these questions:

-   Does the server have the expected network interfaces and IPs up and running?  `ifconfig`
-   Does the server listen on the sockets that it is supposed to?  `netstat`  (`netstat -lpd`  or  `netstat -lpn`)
-   Can you connect from the location you want to connect from, to the socket you want to connect to?  `telnet`  to the IP + PORT (`telnet 8.8.8.8 80`)
-   Does the server have the correct firewall rules?  `iptables`,  `ufw`:
    -   `iptables -L`
    -   `sudo ufw status`

## Process issue

If a piece of Software isn’t behaving as expected, it can obviously be because of above reasons… but the good news is that there is more to look into (there is ALWAYS more to look into actually).

-   Is the software started?  `init`,  `init.d`:
    -   `service NAME_OF_THE_SERVICE status`
    -   `/etc/init.d/NAME_OF_THE_SERVICE status`
-   Is the software process running?  `pgrep`,  `ps`:
    -   `pgrep -lf NAME_OF_THE_PROCESS`
    -   `ps auxf`
-   Is there anything interesting in the logs? look for log files in  `/var/log/`  and  `tail -f`  is your friend

## Debugging is fun

Debugging can be frustrating, but it will definitely be part of your job, it requires experience and methodology to become good at it. The good news is that bugs are never going away, and the more experienced you become, trickier bugs will be assigned to you! Good luck :)

Your web infrastructure is already serving web pages via  `Nginx`  that you installed in your  [first web stack project](https://github.com/OluTshegz/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x0C-web_server "first web stack project"). While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server. In this project you will add this piece to your infrastructure, plug it to your  `Nginx`  and make is serve your Airbnb clone project.

## Tasks

### 0. Set up development with Python

mandatory

Let’s serve what you built for  [AirBnB clone v2 - Web framework](https://github.com/OluTshegz/AirBnB_clone_v2 "AirBnB clone v2 - Web framework")  on  `web-01`. This task is an exercise in setting up your development environment, which is used for testing and debugging your code before deploying it to production.

Requirements:

-   Make sure that  [task #3](https://github.com/OluTshegz/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x0B-ssh "task #3")  of your  [SSH project](https://github.com/OluTshegz/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x0B-ssh "SSH project")  is completed for  `web-01`. The checker will connect to your servers.
-   Install the  `net-tools`  package on your server:  `sudo apt install -y net-tools`
-   Git clone your  `AirBnB_clone_v2`  on your  `web-01`  server.
-   Configure the file  `web_flask/0-hello_route.py`  to serve its content from the route  `/airbnb-onepage/`  on port  `5000`.
-   Your Flask application object must be named  `app`  (This will allow us to run and check your code).

Example:

##### Window 1:

```
ubuntu@229-web-01:~/AirBnB_clone_v2$ python3 -m web_flask.0-hello_route
 * Serving Flask app "0-hello_route" (lazy loading)

### 1. Set up production with Gunicorn

mandatory

Now that you have your development environment set up, let’s get your production application server set up with  `Gunicorn`  on  `web-01`, port  `5000`. You’ll need to install  `Gunicorn`  and any libraries required by your application. Your  `Flask`  application object will serve as a  [WSGI](https://www.fullstackpython.com/wsgi-servers.html "WSGI")  entry point into your application. This will be your production environment. As you can see we want the production and development of your application to use the same port, so the conditions for serving your dynamic content are the same in both environments.

Requirements:

-   Install  `Gunicorn`  and any other libraries required by your application.
-   The Flask application object should be called  `app`. (This will allow us to run and check your code)
-   You will serve the same content from the same route as in the previous task. You can verify that it’s working by binding a  `Gunicorn`  instance to localhost listening on port  `5000`  with your application object as the entry point.
-   In order to check your code, the checker will bind a  `Gunicorn`  instance to port  `6000`, so make sure nothing is listening on that port.

Example:

##### Terminal 1:

```
ubuntu@229-web-01:~/AirBnB_clone_v2$ gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 web_flask.0-hello_route:app
[2019-05-03 20:47:20 +0000] [3595] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.9.0

[2019-05-03 20:47:20 +0000] [3598] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 3598

```

##### Terminal 2:

```
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$ curl 127.0.0.1:5000/airbnb-onepage/
Hello HBNB!ubuntu@229-web-01:~$

```

### 2. Serve a page with Nginx

mandatory

Building on your work in the previous tasks, configure  `Nginx`  to serve your page from the route  `/airbnb-onepage/`

Requirements:

-   `Nginx`  must serve this page both locally and on its public IP on port  `80`.
-   `Nginx`  should proxy requests to the process listening on port  `5000`.
-   Include your  `Nginx`  config file as  `2-app_server-nginx_config`.

Notes:

-   In order to test this you’ll have to spin up either your production or development application server (listening on port  `5000`)
-   In an actual production environment the application server will be configured to start upon startup in a system initialization script. This will be covered in the advanced tasks.
-   You will probably need to  `reboot`  your server (by using the command  `$ sudo reboot`) to have Nginx publicly accessible

Example:

#### On my server:

##### Window 1:

```
ubuntu@229-web-01:~/AirBnB_clone_v2$ gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 web_flask.0-hello_route:app
[2019-05-06 20:43:57 +0000] [14026] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.9.0
[2019-05-06 20:43:57 +0000] [14026] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:5000 (14026)
[2019-05-06 20:43:57 +0000] [14026] [INFO] Using worker: sync
[2019-05-06 20:43:57 +0000] [14029] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 14029

```

##### Window 2:

```
ubuntu@229-web-01:~/AirBnB_clone_v2$ curl 127.0.0.1/airbnb-onepage/
Hello HBNB!ubuntu@229-web-01:~/AirBnB_clone_v2$

```

#### On my local terminal:

```

### 3. Add a route with query parameters

mandatory

Building on what you did in the previous tasks, let’s expand our web application by adding another service for  `Gunicorn`  to handle. In  `AirBnB_clone_v2/web_flask/6-number_odd_or_even`, the route  `/number_odd_or_even/<int:n>`  should already be defined to render a page telling you whether an integer is odd or even. You’ll need to configure  `Nginx`  to proxy HTTP requests to the route  `/airbnb-dynamic/number_odd_or_even/(any integer)`  to a  `Gunicorn`  instance listening on port  `5001`. The key to this exercise is getting  `Nginx`  configured to proxy requests to processes listening on two different ports. You are not expected to keep your application server processes running. If you want to know how to run multiple instances of  `Gunicorn`  without having multiple terminals open, see tips below.

Requirements:

-   `Nginx`  must serve this page both locally and on its public IP on port  `80`.
-   `Nginx`  should proxy requests to the route  `/airbnb-dynamic/number_odd_or_even/(any integer)`  the process listening on port  `5001`.
-   Include your  `Nginx`  config file as  `3-app_server-nginx_config`.

Tips:

-   Check out these articles/docs for clues on how to configure  `Nginx`:  [Understanding Nginx Server and Location Block Selection Algorithms](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-nginx-server-and-location-block-selection-algorithms#matching-location-blocks "Understanding Nginx Server and Location Block Selection Algorithms"),  [Understanding Nginx Location Blocks Rewrite Rules](http://blog.pixelastic.com/2013/09/27/understanding-nginx-location-blocks-rewrite-rules/ "Understanding Nginx Location Blocks Rewrite Rules"),  [Nginx Reverse Proxy](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/# "Nginx Reverse Proxy").
-   In order to spin up a  `Gunicorn`  instance as a detached process you can use the terminal multiplexer utility  `tmux`. Enter the command  `tmux new-session -d 'gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5001 web_flask.6-number_odd_or_even:app'`  and if successful you should see no output to the screen. You can verify that the process has been created by running  `pgrep gunicorn`  to see its PID. Once you’re ready to end the process you can either run  `tmux a`  to reattach to the processes, or you can run  `kill <PID>`  to terminate the background process by ID.

Example:

##### Terminal 1:

```
ubuntu@229-web-01:~/AirBnB_clone_v2$ tmux new-session -d 'gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 web_flask.0-hello_route:app'

### 4. Let's do this for your API

mandatory

Let’s serve what you built for  [AirBnB clone v3 - RESTful API](https://github.com/OluTshegz/AirBnB_clone_v3 "AirBnB clone v3 - RESTful API")  on  `web-01`.

Requirements:

-   Git clone your  `AirBnB_clone_v3`
-   Setup  `Nginx`  so that the route  `/api/`  points to a  `Gunicorn`  instance listening on port  `5002`
-   `Nginx`  must serve this page both locally and on its public IP on port  `80`
-   To test your setup you should bind  `Gunicorn`  to  `api/v1/app.py`
-   It may be helpful to import your data (and environment variables) from  [this project](https://github.com/OluTshegz/AirBnB_clone_v2 "this project")
-   Upload your  `Nginx`  config file as  `4-app_server-nginx_config`

Example:

##### Terminal 1:

### 5. Serve your AirBnB clone

mandatory

Let’s serve what you built for  [AirBnB clone - Web dynamic](https://github.com/Mohamed-Ali7/AirBnB_clone_v4 "AirBnB clone - Web dynamic")  on  `web-01`.

Requirements:

-   Git clone your  `AirBnB_clone_v4`
-   Your  `Gunicorn`  instance should serve content from  `web_dynamic/2-hbnb.py`  on port  `5003`
-   Setup  `Nginx`  so that the route  `/`  points to your  `Gunicorn`  instance
-   Setup  `Nginx`  so that it properly serves the static assets found in  `web_dynamic/static/`  (this is essential for your page to render properly)
-   For your website to be fully functional, you will need to reconfigure  `web_dynamic/static/scripts/2-hbnb.js`  to the correct IP
-   `Nginx`  must serve this page both locally and on its public IP and port  `5003`
-   Make sure to pull up your Developer Tools on your favorite browser to verify that you have no errors
-   Upload your  `Nginx`  config as  `5-app_server-nginx_config`

After loading, your website should look like this:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2020/9/7a8a7c33021b1b74f9cdc1fd8f855bdb1f8cd44e.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20240610%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240610T122354Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=52cfec144763552b3313416f7dee2573d94109b4ebb53f19e90079952f978d35)

### 6. Deploy it!

#advanced

Once you’ve got your application server configured, you want to set it up to run by default when Linux is booted. This way when your server inevitably requires downtime (you have to shut it down or restart it for one reason or another), your  `Gunicorn`  process(es) will start up as part of the system initialization process, freeing you from having to manually restart them. For this we will use  `systemd`. You can read more about  `systemd`  in the documentation posted at the top of this project but to put it succinctly, it is a system initialization daemon for the Linux OS (amongst other things). For this task you will write a  `systemd`  script which will start your application server for you. As mentioned in the video at the top of the project, you do not need to create a Unix socket to bind the process to.

**Requirements:**

-   Write a  `systemd`  script which starts a  `Gunicorn`  process to serve the same content as the previous task (`web_dynamic/2-hbnb.py`)
-   The  `Gunicorn`  process should spawn 3 worker processes
-   The process should log errors in  `/tmp/airbnb-error.log`
-   The process should log access in  `/tmp/airbnb-access.log`
-   The process should be bound to port  `5003`
-   Your  `systemd`  script should be stored in the appropriate directory on  `web-01`
-   Make sure that you start the  `systemd`  service and leave it running
-   Upload  `gunicorn.service`  to GitHub

### 7. No service interruption

#advanced

One of the most important metrics for any Internet-based business is its uptime. It is the percentage of the time over a given period that the service/product is accessible to customers. Let’s pick the example of Amazon.com, for every minute of downtime (which is the opposite of uptime),  [it costs the company $2M](https://storageservers.wordpress.com/2016/03/14/amazon-downtime-costs-2-million-loss-per-minute/ "it costs the company $2M"). Yet, application servers often need to restart to update with the new version of the code or new configuration, when doing this operation, an application server cannot serve traffic, which meant downtime.

To avoid this; application servers are designed with a master/workers infrastructure. The master is in charge of:

-   Receiving requests
-   Managing workers (starting, stopping)
-   Distributing requests to workers

Workers are the actual ones processing the query by generation dynamic content by processing the application code.

To update an application without downtime, the master will proceed with a progressive rollout of the update. It will gracefully shut down some workers ( meaning that it will tell workers to finish processing the request they are working on, but will not send them new requests, once the worker is done, it’s will be shutdown) and start new ones with the new application code or configuration, then move on to the other old workers until it has renewed the whole pool.

Write a simple Bash script to reload Gunicorn in a graceful way.

Example:

```

```

In this example, you can see that my Bash script tells the master Gunicorn renewed all the workers.

For testing it, please use the command  `$ sudo reboot`  to reboot your server (not  `shutdown`!!)
